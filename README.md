# Black-Friday-hackathon
This is my approach on Analytics Vidhya Black Friday hackathon.
My goal is to practice my skills on exploratory data analysis, features selection and engineering, modeling, parameter tuning, and evaluating results .Before starting this project, I read a series of Kaggle notebooks created by Kaggler Will Koehsen, where he explained the concepts and procedures of machine learning comprehensibly. <br>

Black Friday Sales Analysis.ipynb includes exploratory data analysis, data cleaning and munging, features engineering and selections, modeling, and model evaluations. <br>

The other two files detail the model parameters tuning with Grid Search and Bayesian methods.
